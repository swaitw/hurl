# Hurl implements curl's behaviour on redirect:
#
# From <https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#-L>:
# > When curl follows a redirect and if the request is a POST, it sends the following request
# > with a GET if the HTTP response was 301, 302, or 303. If the response code was any other 3xx
# > code, curl resends the following request using the same unmodified method.
#
# In the following test, we send an `Accept` header to check that any header (except `Authorization`
# are redirected to the final URL.
