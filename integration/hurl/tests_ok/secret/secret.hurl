# When run in normal mode (vs --test mode), log on standard error are logged immediately. Variables that are
# redacted may have leaked their value in the logged network call (from headers, libcurl etc...). So, if there
# are captured redacted variables in a entry, we do not authorize to set verbosity to prevent any chance of leaking.
# NOTE: in test mode, there is no risk of leaks even in verbose mode, as standard error logs are buffered and redacted
# before being printed.
